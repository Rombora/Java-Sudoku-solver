# Java-Sudoku-solver
A java algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle

A sudoku puzzle is already initialized in the source code.

To customize a puzzle, edit the 'GRID' in the source code, then save the 'Sudoku.java' file.

## Compile the java file
`javac Sudoku.java`

This creates the file 'Sudoku.class'

Run the file using
`java Sudoku`

The output will be the solution of the sudoku puzzle. That is if it can be solved.

If the sudoku puzzle does not have a solution, feedback will be returned.
